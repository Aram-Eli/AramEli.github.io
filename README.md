# Quick Landing Page

_I have the very basic of HTML and CSS with Bootstrap styling all links are updated:_

> Git clone //To clone the repo

or **Make a quick visit**

_What actually led me to upload this Landing page is I used mailing services Like [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)_
Although it might be slightly vague on how to use these services and connect them to 
your projects general I realised they fall on the same path of deployment.

pretty excited gg
